Generate $N short Scala code snippets related to the topic of **$TOPIC**. These snippets should demonstrate the **non-idiomatic** use of `null` checks or assignments in Scala, where using `Option` would be preferred.

Focus on examples within the $TOPIC context showing:
- Explicit `if (x == null)` or `if (x != null)` checks on data relevant to $TOPIC.
- Assigning `null` to a `var` or `val` representing potentially missing data in the $TOPIC domain.
- Returning `null` from a function that queries or retrieves data relevant to $TOPIC.
- Interacting with hypothetical Java libraries related to $TOPIC that might return null.

Ensure the code is syntactically valid Scala. Keep snippets relatively short (up to 10 to 15 lines long). Provide $N distinct examples related to $TOPIC.
