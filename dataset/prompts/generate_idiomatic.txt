Generate $N short Scala code snippets related to the topic of **$TOPIC**. These snippets should demonstrate **idiomatic** Scala practices specifically regarding the avoidance of `null`, the handling of recoverable errors, and the definition of simple data structures, all within the $TOPIC context.

Focus on examples within the $TOPIC context showing:
- Use of `Option` (e.g., `Some`, `None`, `.map`, `.getOrElse`, pattern matching) for potentially missing data relevant to $TOPIC.
- Use of `Try` or `Either` for functions that might fail with recoverable errors during operations related to $TOPIC (e.g., parsing, calculation, I/O).
- Use of `case class` for simple, immutable data aggregates relevant to $TOPIC.
- Combinations of these idiomatic patterns within the $TOPIC domain.

Ensure the code is syntactically valid Scala and clearly demonstrates one or more of the target idiomatic patterns. Keep snippets relatively short (up to 10 to 15 lines long). Provide $N distinct examples related to $TOPIC covering different idiomatic scenarios.
