Generate $N short Scala code snippets related to the topic of **$TOPIC**. These snippets should demonstrate the **non-idiomatic** use of `throw` for handling potentially recoverable errors or flow control, where using `Try`, `Either`, or `Option` would be more idiomatic in Scala.

Focus on examples within the $TOPIC context like:
- Throwing exceptions for invalid input that could be represented as `None` or `Left`.
- Throwing exceptions for conditions like division by zero within a function that could return a `Try[Int]`.
- Simple functions or expressions clearly showing the `throw new ...` pattern in a context where it's likely avoidable.

Ensure the code is syntactically valid Scala. Keep snippets relatively short (up to 10 to 15 lines long). Provide $N distinct examples related to $TOPIC.
