Generate $N short Scala 3 code snippets related to the topic of **$TOPIC**. These snippets should demonstrate the **non-idiomatic** use of a regular `class` where a `case class` would typically be preferred in idiomatic Scala 3 for simple data structures.

Focus on examples within the $TOPIC context where the `class`:
- Primarily serves as a simple, immutable data holder relevant to $TOPIC (e.g., User, Product, Transaction, Coordinate).
- Has constructor parameters that are mostly or all `val`s.
- Has few or no methods, beyond maybe simple getters.
- Lacks complex internal logic or state management.

Ensure the code is syntactically valid Scala 3 defining a class. 
Keep the class definitions simple (up to 30 lines long). 
Provide $N distinct examples related to $TOPIC.
Add a bit of variance in the code snippets. Use a different numbers of arguments / class variables; different code structrures.
The generated snippet should be a valid top-level Scala 3 program.
